## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
Data <- data[which(data$steps!= "NA"), ]
DataF <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = Data, sum)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
hist(DataF$steps,main="Histogram of Steps",xlab="Steps")
```
  
- The mean of steps per day is **`r mean(DataF$steps)`**  
- The median of steps per day is **`r median(DataF$steps)`**  

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
#### Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r}
SInterval<-aggregate(steps~interval,data=Data,mean)
plot(steps~interval,data=SInterval,type="l")
```  

- Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?  
The interval with maximum number of steps is **`r SInterval[which.max(SInterval$steps), ]$interval` th** interval

## Imputing missing values
#### Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset  
- The total de missing value is **`r sum(is.na(data$steps))`**   

#### Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in   

```{r}
Sintervals<-function(interval){
        SInterval[SInterval$interval==interval,]$steps
}
countInterval=0
for(n in 1:nrow(data)){
        if(is.na(data[n,]$steps)){
                data[n,]$steps<-Sintervals(data[n,]$interval)
                countInterval=countInterval + 1
        }
}

```  
- The total of NA values were filled is **`r countInterval`**   

#### Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
totalSteps<- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = data, sum)
hist(totalSteps$steps)
```  

- The mean total number of steps taken per day is **`r round(mean(totalSteps$steps))`**  
- The median total number of steps taken per day is **`r round(median(totalSteps$steps))`**  

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

#### Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels -- "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r}
data$day=ifelse(as.POSIXlt(as.Date(data$date))$wday%%6==0,"weekend","weekday")
data$day=factor(data$day,levels=c("weekday","weeked"))
```


#### Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).
```{r}
sInterval=aggregate(steps~interval+day,data,mean)
library(lattice)
xyplot(steps~interval|factor(day),data=sInterval,aspect=1/2,type = "l")
```
